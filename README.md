# [AIR Controller Tester](http://brettchalupa.github.com/AIR-Controller-Tester/)

AIR Controller Tester displays input from controllers.

It currently supports up to 16 controllers. Testing controllers is hot-swappable.

## Contributing

## TODO

* Make the whole thing not run terribly slow (this is my fault, not the controller input's fault)
