# [AIR Controller Tester](http://brettchalupa.github.com/AIR-Controller-Tester/)

AIR Controller Tester displays input from controllers.

It currently supports up to 16 controllers. Testing controllers is hot-swappable.

It starts to chug at 2 controllers. x____x

I am currently working on optimizing this for testing with multiple controllers.

## Download

[Download the latest version.](https://github.com/brettchalupa/AIR-Controller-Tester/downloads)

## Contributing

Master branch is the latest version, development branch is whatever I am working on.

## TODO

* Make the whole thing not run terribly slow (this is my fault, not the controller input's fault)
* Change the way multiple inputs are managed

## About

AIR Controller Tester is a program for checking the input of controller input. It allows the user to see the different axes and button indices. This is useful for coding with the native control solution in Flash.

## Thanks

-   [Alexander O’Mara][] - Native controller support wouldn’t be
    possible without JoyQuery 2.0, now let’s start working on a Mac
    version. :)
-   [Kyle Pulver][] - Thanks for giving me a reason to get this working
    with FlashDevelop 4.0, FlashPunk and Flixel. All I want is to play
    Offspring Fling with native controller support.
-   [Flixel][] - Pretty much one of the most awesome game creating
    libraries. This project uses it, and it just makes everything super
    simple.
